# Introduction

Welcome to Payswitch API Documentation! You can use our API to access Payswitch API endpoints, which allows you to connect to our platform's services and start creating your own app.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
